      <h1>Child Marriage</h1>
      <p class="quote">
        Girls face multiple challenges purely because of their age and gender.
        In many of the world’s poorest places, the odds are stacked against them
        when factors like ethnicity and disability heighten the existing
        disadvantages that they face. From being denied an education to being
        forced into child marriage, girls face a myriad of obstacles that
        prevent them from realizing their full potential.

        Child marriage is rooted in inequality between men and women and
        discriminatory views towards a girl’s value, sexuality, and role in
        society. Ending child marriage is a strategic way of tackling gender
        inequality and shifting the discriminatory norms that perpetuate child
        marriage. <br />
